Hi Tom, made a new template again.

On the title screen you click to start. Then you click one of the blue rectangles to select which quadrant you'd like the seeker to start in.


Five ships then launch from the start point to seek the goal. The first four are scouts. They use our Manhattan-based A-Star algorithm to find
paths. The fifth ship then follows the shortest of those paths. (Each scout saves all the tiles it covers in a vector called mPath. Once all four
have finished their flights, the all the tiles in the shortest mPath have their weights set to 0, so the fifth ship is forced to follow that path.)

We first implemented an augmented Manhattan heuristic (still visible in Tile.cpp), which was actually much better at finding an efficient path. But
in the end we implemented a basic Manhattan because it created more ties between tile weights, which allowed the seekers to find a wider variety of
paths by using randomization to break ties. The Augmented Manhattan was a better pathfinder, but less interesting because all the seekers tended to
find the same path.
